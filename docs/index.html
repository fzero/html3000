      <h1>A Better Way to Write HTML for Modern Apps</h1>

      <p>
        For decades, web developers have been taught to think of HTML as a
        document language. When Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML, every tag meant
        something. A heading was a heading. A paragraph was a paragraph. The
        markup itself told you what the content was, and browsers knew how to
        treat it. That’s what <em>semantic HTML</em> means.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the web has changed. Today, the majority of what we build are
        applications, not documents. And the metaphors of documents don’t always
        fit application interfaces. Carousels, badges, counters, avatars,
        alerts–none of these map neatly to <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Instead, we’ve
        been shoehorning them into non-semantic catch-alls:
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It’s time to say it: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> are crutches. They’re lazy. They don’t mean
        anything. And the fact that our modern front-ends are built almost
        entirely out of them is… embarrassing.
      </p>

      <h2>Why <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s Are Harmful</h2>

      <p>
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s are the duct tape of web development. They:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hide the true structure of the UI.</li>
        <li>Depend on fragile, bloated class names for meaning.</li>
        <li>
          Make code unreadable – it takes mental effort to decode what a
          Tailwind block is actually doing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage short-term hacks instead of long-term maintainable patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The irony is that React developers already know this. They write
        <code>&lt;Panel&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;Logo&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Nav&gt;</code> every day in JSX.
        Those are semantic! But paradoxically, the same community often declares
        that semantic HTML is “dead.” I’d argue it isn’t. In fact, semantic HTML
        is more important than ever.
      </p>

      <h2>HTML in 2025: Underused and Undervalued</h2>

      <p>
        The truth is, HTML and CSS in 2025 are more powerful than many
        developers realize. Features like CSS nesting, attribute selectors, and
        custom elements give us expressive, declarative tools that work
        everywhere–without JavaScript or build systems. Put together, these
        practices feel futuristic, even though most of them have been around for
        years.
      </p>

      <p>That’s why I call this approach <strong>HTML3000</strong>.</p>

      <h2>The Principles</h2>

      <p>
        At its core, HTML3000 is about leaning into semantics and writing HTML
        that describes <em>what</em> an element is, not just <em>how</em> it
        looks. The key principles are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use custom HTML tags extensively.</strong> No
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. If you feel
            you need these tags, take a step back and figure out what you
            actually mean.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Favor context and nesting over class soup.</strong> Remember
            what the “C” in CSS stands for.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use attributes instead of classes as CSS hooks.</strong>
            Double down on declarative patterns.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Start with simple reusable patterns.</strong> Reach for Web
            Components only when necessary.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript comes last.</strong> Focus on structure and
            styling before behavior.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal isn’t to throw out modern tooling. HTML3000 plays nicely with
        ERB, Hotwire, Stimulus, HTMX, React, Vue, Phoenix LiveView, and more.
        It’s “just HTML” but written differently.
      </p>

      <h2>What You Gain Without <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Readable code</strong> – you know what’s on the page without
          tracing through CSS classes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintainability</strong> – meaningful tags are easier to
          refactor and extend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency</strong> – you naturally create component patterns
          instead of ad hoc markup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Freedom from bloat</strong> – less dependence on utility
          libraries to patch over missing semantics.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Using semantic, declarative markup makes code easier to read, reason
        about, and maintain. Instead of wading through endless utility classes,
        you see the actual structure of your UI. Consistency emerges naturally,
        and you’re nudged toward building standardized, reusable components.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is this a design system? Nope! But any serious application needs
        consistent UX, and HTML3000 encourages you to think in components from
        the start.
      </p>

      <h2>Adopting HTML3000 Incrementally</h2>

      <p>
        You don’t need to rewrite everything overnight. Even small steps–like
        replacing anonymous <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s with meaningful custom
        tags–can dramatically improve readability. You can go further by
        experimenting with attribute selectors or phasing out class-heavy
        patterns where they don’t serve you.

      </ul>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

      <p>
        HTML3000 isn’t a framework, library, or package you install. It’s a set
        of practices that rediscover the expressive power of HTML and CSS–tools
        that already run everywhere. It’s about writing code for the web that’s
        semantic, declarative, and future-proof.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the early web was about documents, and the last decade was about
        JavaScript-driven UIs, perhaps the next step is recognizing that the
        simplest building blocks–HTML and CSS–already take us surprisingly far.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML3000 isn’t just a practice. It’s a promise:
        <strong>no more meaningless markup.</strong> Because the future of the
        web shouldn’t be meaningless.
