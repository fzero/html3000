      <h1>A Better Way to Write HTML for Modern Apps</h1>

      <p>
        When Tim Berners-Lee invented HTML his idea was to share documents –
        scientific papers to be precise. This document shape is still with us
        after all this time. That's why we have elements like
        <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> and so on.
      </p>

      <p>
        This works great for articles and blogs, but the web has changed. Today
        the majority of what we build are applications, not documents, and the
        metaphors of documents don’t always fit application interfaces.
        Carousels, badges, counters, avatars, alerts – none of these map neatly
        to <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, or
        <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>. Instead, we’ve been shoehorning them into
        non-semantic catch-alls: <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> and
        <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Why <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s Are Harmful</h2>

      <p>
        <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s are the duct tape of web development. They:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hide the true structure of the UI.</li>
        <li>Depend on fragile, bloated class names for meaning.</li>
        <li>
          Make code unreadable – it takes mental effort to decode what a
          Tailwind block is actually doing.
        </li>
        <li>
          Encourage short-term hacks instead of long-term maintainable patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The irony is that React developers already know this. They write
        <code>&lt;Panel&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Button&gt;</code>,
        <code>&lt;Logo&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;Nav&gt;</code> every day in JSX.
        Those are semantic! But paradoxically, the same community often declares
        that semantic HTML is "dead."
      </p>

      <p>
        It most definitely isn't. In fact, semantic HTML is more important than
        ever.
      </p>

      <h2>HTML in 2025: Underused and Undervalued</h2>

      <p>
        The truth is, HTML and CSS in 2025 are more powerful than many
        developers realize. Features like CSS nesting, attribute selectors, and
        custom elements give us expressive, declarative tools that work
        everywhere without JavaScript or build systems. Put together, these
        practices feel futuristic – like coding in the year 3000! – even though
        most of them have been around for years.
      </p>

      <p>That’s why I call this approach <strong>HTML3000</strong>.</p>

      <h2>The Principles</h2>

      <p>
        At its core, HTML3000 is about leaning into semantics and writing HTML
        that describes <em>what</em> an element is, not just <em>how</em> it
        looks. The key principles are:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use custom HTML tags extensively.</strong> No
            <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>. If you feel
            you need these tags, take a step back and figure out what you
            actually mean.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Favor context and nesting over class soup.</strong> Remember
            what the “C” in CSS stands for.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Use attributes instead of classes as CSS hooks.</strong>
            Double down on declarative patterns.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>Start with reusable patterns</strong> and componentize
            later.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <strong>JavaScript comes last.</strong> Focus on structure and
            styling before behavior.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The goal isn’t to throw out modern tooling. HTML3000 plays nicely with
        ERB, Hotwire, Stimulus, HTMX, React, Vue, Phoenix LiveView, and more.
        It’s "just HTML" but written differently.
      </p>

      <aside>
        <h2>A note on custom tags</h2>

        <p>
          There's quite a bit of confusion about this feature. The TL;DR is
          <strong>
            all you need to use a custom HTML tag is add it to your HTML.
          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          In other words, you can go ahead and type
          <code>&lt;my-tag&gt;</code> on your code and it will behave like a
          <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, that's all. This has been the case since HTML5 was released in
          January of 2008.
        </p>

        <p>
          I believe the confusion began when
          <a
            href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components"
          >
            web components
          </a>
          became a thing. The communication around them was never very clear to
          begin with, so this is no surprise.
        </p>

        <p>
          Rest assured these are two separate features: custom HTML tags don't
          need any Javascript to work. You can simply add them to your code and
          apply CSS defitions as you would for any other HTML tag.
        </p>

        <p>
          That's how we're getting rid of <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and
          <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> in favour of fully semantic tags to describe
          applications UIs.

      <h2>What You Gain Without <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Readable code</strong> – you know what’s on the page without
          tracing through CSS classes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maintainability</strong> – meaningful tags are easier to
          refactor and extend.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consistency</strong> – naming things pushes you to think in
          component patterns instead of ad hoc markup.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Freedom from bloat</strong> – less dependence on utility
          libraries to patch over missing semantics.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Why This Matters</h2>

      <p>
        Using semantic, declarative markup makes code easier to read, reason
        about and maintain. Instead of wading through endless utility classes
        you see the actual structure of your UI. Consistency emerges naturally
        and you’re nudged toward building standardized, reusable components.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Is this a design system?</strong> Nope! But any serious
        application needs consistent UX, and HTML3000 encourages you to think in
        components from the start.
      </p>

      <h2>Adopting HTML3000 Incrementally</h2>

      <p>
        You don’t need to rewrite everything overnight. Even small steps like
        replacing anonymous <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s with meaningful custom
        tags can dramatically improve readability. You can go further by
        experimenting with attribute selectors or phasing out class-heavy
        patterns where they don’t serve you.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

      <p>
        HTML3000 isn’t a framework, library, or package you install. It’s a set
        of practices that rediscover the expressive power of HTML and CSS –
        tools that already run everywhere. It’s about writing code for the web
        that’s semantic, declarative, and future-proof.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the early web was about documents and the last decade was about
        JavaScript-driven UIs, perhaps the next step is recognizing that the
        simplest building blocks – HTML and CSS – already take us surprisingly
        far.
      </p>

      <p>
        HTML3000 isn’t just a practice. It’s a promise:
        <strong>no more meaningless markup.</strong> Because the future of the
        web shouldn’t be meaningless.
      </p>
